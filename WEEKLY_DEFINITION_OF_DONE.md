# Weekly Definition of Done (DoD)
Multi-Timeframe Forex Trading System

This document defines what it means for each week of the project to be considered "complete".

Progress is measured by confidence and verification, not code volume.

---

## Week 1 – Foundation & Stability
The system runs end-to-end on one pair and one timeframe.
All modules import cleanly and export a chart payload.
I can visually inspect candles and pattern markers.

---

## Week 2 – Charting v0
I can open a chart and visually see candles and pattern markers.
Pattern placement matches expectations.

---

## Week 3 – Candle Classification
Candle types are stable, tested, and visually correct.
Edge cases behave as expected both in tests and on charts.

---

## Week 4 – Pattern Engine
Multi-candle patterns are reliable and explainable.
I can click a pattern marker and understand why it fired.

---

## Week 5 – Market Structure
BOS and CTS levels appear where I would place them manually.
Breakout and pullback logic behaves consistently across samples.

---

## Week 6 – Indicators
Indicator signals appear in logical clusters.
They add clarity rather than noise.

---

## Week 7 – Zones
Zones are drawn correctly and have meaningful strength differentiation.
Strong zones visually look strong.

---

## Week 8 – Multi-Timeframe Confluence
HTF and LTF context aligns logically.
Confluence vs non-confluence is visually obvious.

---

## Week 9 – Entries
Planned entries, stops, and TPs make sense without explanation.
RR enforcement behaves correctly.

---

## Week 10 – Backtesting & Live Readiness
Backtests are deterministic and explainable.
Executed trades match chart logic.
Live dry-run behaves identically to backtest logic.
