# Multi-Timeframe Forex Trading System

This repository contains a research-first, event-driven, multi-timeframe forex trading system.
The system is designed to formalize discretionary market-structure concepts into a deterministic,
testable, and explainable trading engine.

The project prioritizes correctness, interpretability, and reproducibility over speed or complexity.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Encode discretionary market structure concepts (BOS, CTS, zones, patterns) into code
- Support multi-timeframe analysis (HTF context → LTF execution)
- Provide strong visual validation via charting
- Enable deterministic backtesting and walk-forward optimization
- Support safe automation via Oanda (dry-run → live)
- Preserve explainability at every decision point

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy (Read This First)

This system follows several non-negotiable principles:

- **Explainability > Performance**
- **Interfaces before behavior**
- **Visual validation is mandatory**
- **Research engine first, trading bot second**
- **Event-driven by design**
- **Optimization refines logic — it never replaces it**

These principles are documented in detail in `PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md`.
